## 📊 Telco Customer Churn Analysis

## 🔍 Overview

Customer churn is a critical metric in the telecom industry, reflecting the percentage of customers who stop using a company's services during a given period. Understanding the reasons behind churn helps companies take proactive steps to retain their customers and enhance satisfaction.
This project involves an in-depth analysis of customer churn patterns using a real-world dataset from a telecom company. The data is visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard that enables stakeholders to explore key business questions such as:
What demographic or service-related factors contribute to churn?
Which customer segments are most likely to leave?
How do contract types and payment methods affect customer loyalty?
By leveraging data visualization and statistical insights, this project empowers decision-makers to:
Detect early warning signs of churn
